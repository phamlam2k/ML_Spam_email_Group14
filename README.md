### Project Name: Spam Email Detection
### Project description:
__In this project, we will build a spam email classifier that can tell whether a given email is a spam email or not based on the email’s content. In the email classification, after preprocessing the email contents, we will use algorithms to train our dataset which are bags-of-words, logistic regression, LIME. In algorithm, we can find the best model. After we get the training results from the training set, evaluate the model to discuss our results and judge our models.__

### Project plan:
- Clean up the data set. Our dataset is from __spam_or_not_spam.csv__
- Preprocessing emails. 
- Importing libraries sklearn, LinearRegression, lime
- Feature extraction.  
- Train the data (Use Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistics Regression and LIME) + process from NLP's Course
- Test our models for test set, and get results. 
- Calculate to judge our model, such as precision, recall, F1-score and so on.
- Conclude and discuss the results # spam_ham_email_dectec
